Sadly, the console-management function(s) in conio_min.cpp 
do not work with Chinese text, for some reason...
Even the initial newline on command entry does not work...

Example:
//  however, Chinese does not work quite right...
//  See unicons.chinese.jpg
I suspect the issue is with the console itself, rather than my code...
